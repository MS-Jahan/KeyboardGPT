**Goal**: Working, reliable voice-to-text
**Time**: 27-35 hours

1. ✅ add-audio-permissions (2-3h)
2. ✅ audio-recorder-service (6-8h)
3. ✅ gemini-audio-support (8-10h)
4. ✅ voice-input-command (6-8h)
5. ✅ voice-retry-mechanism (5-6h) ← **Essential for reliability**

**Deliverable**: Voice-to-text works with automatic retry

### Phase 2: Enhanced UX (P1 - Polish)

**Time**: 22-27 hours

6. ✅ voice-ui-feedback (8-10h)
7. ✅ voice-button-hook (10-12h)
8. ✅ voice-custom-prompts (4-5h) ← **NEW**

**Deliverable**: Button-triggered with visual feedback and customization

### Phase 3: Long-term (P2 - Maintenance)
**Goal**: Prevent storage issues
**Time**: 5-6 hours

9. ✅ audio-file-management (5-6h)

**Deliverable**: No storage bloat over time

## Feature Capabilities

### Core Features (After Phase 1)
✅ Record voice input via microphone
✅ Upload audio to Gemini API
✅ Transcribe speech to text
✅ Insert text into keyboard input
✅ Handle permissions properly
✅ Auto-retry on network failures (2-3 attempts)
✅ Manual retry without re-recording
✅ Basic error handling

### Enhanced Features (After Phase 2)
✅ Voice button triggers feature
✅ Visual feedback (recording, processing, success, error)
✅ Audio level visualization
✅ Haptic feedback
✅ Customize transcription prompts
✅ Preset prompt templates (raw, corrected, formal, etc.)
✅ Custom user-defined prompts
✅ Keyboard compatibility (Gboard, SwiftKey, etc.)

### Maintenance Features (After Phase 3)
✅ Automatic audio file cleanup
✅ Cache size management
✅ Storage space checking
✅ Manual cache clearing

---

## Key Innovations

### 1. Intelligent Retry (Proposal 9)
**Problem**: Network glitches force users to re-record
**Solution**: Auto-retry with exponential backoff + manual retry using cached audio

**Benefits**:
- 30-50% higher success rate
- No re-recording on transient failures
- Professional error handling
- Better user experience

### 2. Custom Prompts (Proposal 8)
**Problem**: One-size-fits-all transcription doesn't suit all needs
**Solution**: Customizable prompts with presets

**Benefits**:
- Grammar correction on-demand
- Formal vs casual tone
- Summarization option
- Custom formatting
- No post-editing needed

### 3. Voice Button Hook (Proposal 5)
**Problem**: Users don't know how to trigger feature
**Solution**: Intercept keyboard's voice button

**Benefits**:
- Familiar UX (users already use voice button)
- No new UI to learn
- Seamless integration
- Works across keyboards
