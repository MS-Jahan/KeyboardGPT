**Time**: 22-29 hours

### Week 1, Days 1-2
âœ… **Proposal 1: add-audio-permissions** (2-3h)
- Add RECORD_AUDIO permission to manifest
- Implement PermissionManager
- Test permission flows

âœ… **Proposal 2: audio-recorder-service** (6-8h)
- Implement AudioRecorder with MediaRecorder
- Add audio level monitoring
- Test recording on multiple devices

**Checkpoint**: Can record audio to file âœ“

### Week 1, Days 3-4
âœ… **Proposal 3: gemini-audio-support** (8-10h)
- Extend GeminiClient for audio
- Implement Files API upload
- Test transcription accuracy

**Checkpoint**: Can transcribe audio files âœ“

### Week 1, Day 5
âœ… **Proposal 4: voice-input-command** (6-8h)
- Implement VoiceInputCommand
- Orchestrate recording â†’ upload â†’ transcribe
- Test complete workflow

**Checkpoint**: Voice-to-text works end-to-end âœ“

**MVP COMPLETE** - Feature is functional, can be tested

---

## Phase 2: Polish (P1 - User Experience)
**Goal**: Production-ready with great UX
**Time**: 18-22 hours

### Week 2, Days 1-3
âœ… **Proposal 5: voice-button-hook** (10-12h)
- Hook keyboard voice buttons
- Test on Gboard, SwiftKey, others

- Implement VoiceInputDialog
- Add recording/processing/success/error views
- Add haptic feedback
- Test accessibility

**Checkpoint**: Clear visual feedback at all stages âœ“

---

## Phase 3: Maintenance (P2 - Long-term)
**Goal**: Prevent issues over time
**Time**: 5-6 hours

### Week 2, End
âœ… **Proposal 7: audio-file-management** (5-6h)
- Implement automatic cleanup
- Add cache management
- Add settings for manual clear

**Checkpoint**: No storage bloat âœ“

## Testing Milestones

### After Phase 1 (MVP)
- [ ] Can record voice successfully
- [ ] Can transcribe to text
- [ ] Text inserts into keyboard
- [ ] Errors display appropriately
- [ ] Works without voice button (manual trigger)

### After Phase 2 (Polish)
- [ ] Voice button triggers feature
- [ ] Clear UI at each stage
- [ ] User can cancel at any point
- [ ] Works on 3+ keyboard apps
- [ ] Accessible to screen readers

### After Phase 3 (Complete)
- [ ] No storage buildup over time
- [ ] Cache auto-cleans correctly
- [ ] Manual clear works
- [ ] Storage warnings functional

---

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Keyboard Compatibility** (Proposal 5)
   - Test early on target keyboards
   - Have fallback to manual trigger
   - Document incompatibilities

2. **API Quota** (Proposal 3)
   - Add clear error messages
   - Consider rate limiting
   - Monitor usage in testing

3. **Audio Quality** (Proposal 2)
   - Test on various devices
   - Adjust recording parameters if needed
   - Handle noisy environments

### Mitigation Strategy
- Test each proposal thoroughly before moving to next
- Keep fallbacks for critical failures
- Log extensively for debugging
- Start with manual trigger (skip #5 initially if needed)

---

## Alternative Paths

### Path A: Fastest MVP (Skip #5, #7 initially)
1. add-audio-permissions (2-3h)
2. audio-recorder-service (6-8h)
3. gemini-audio-support (8-10h)
4. voice-input-command (6-8h)
6. voice-ui-feedback (8-10h)

**Total**: 30-39h - Working feature with good UX, manual trigger

### Path B: Essential + Button Hook
1-5 only (skip UI polish and file management initially)

**Total**: 32-41h - Button-triggered but basic feedback

### Path C: Phased Release
- v1.0: Proposals 1-4 (MVP)
- v1.1: Add #6 (UI feedback)
- v1.2: Add #5 (voice button)
- v1.3: Add #7 (file management)
